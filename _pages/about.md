<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hello, my name is Zheyu Chen. Currently, I am a Research Assistant at ASTAPLE Lab of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, working under the supervision of Prof. Haibo Hu. I recently completed my Master's degree in Electronic and Information Engineering at the same university's Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. Prior to this, I earned dual Bachelor's degrees through a joint program between University College Dublin (UCD) and Beijing University of Technology (BJUT), graduating with First-Class Honours from UCD and an Honours degree from BJUT in Software Engineering.
My primary research interests lie in data mining, particularly in the field of recommender systems. Specifically, I focus on cutting-edge topics such as multimodal recommendation and group-based recommendation.

[Squeeze and Excitation: A Weighted Graph Contrastive Learning for Collaborative Filtering]()





**<u>Zheyu Chen</u>**, Jinfeng Xu, Yutong Wei, Ziyue Peng,

Paper <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>

- A critical problem in existing GCL-based models is the irrational allocation of feature attention. This problem limits the model's ability to effectively leverage crucial features, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a Weighted Graph Contrastive Learning framework (WeightedGCL). <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>

[COHESION: Composite Graph Convolutional Network with Dual-Stage Fusion for Multimodal Recommendation]()





Jinfeng Xu, **<u>Zheyu Chen</u>**, Wei Wang, Xiping Hu, Sang-Wook Kim, Edith Ngai,

Paper <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>

- Modality fusion and representation learning were considered as two independent processes in previous work. In this paper, we reveal that these two processes are complementary and can support each other. Specifically, powerful representation learning enhances modality fusion, while effective fusion improves representation quality. Stemming from these two processes, we introduce a **CO**mposite grapH convolutional n**E**twork with dual-stage fu**SION** for the multimodal recommendation, named COHESION. <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
